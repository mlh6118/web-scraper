## Web Scraping
## Author: Marni Hager

### Setup
The following must be installed for the web scraping code to work:  
* beautifulsoup4
* requests

### How to run the application:
Enter a URL as an argument to the function being called that has "citation 
needed" on the page. It is recommended to use a wikipedia page for this.

### Tests
Tests were run using print statements that have since been deleted.  

The one notable test was using a paragraph that had two citations needed 
 within it.  

The one test that was not completed was ensuring that the return statements 
for both functions worked the same as the print statements.  Attempts were 
made to run the script from the command line and have the output got to a file 
called "sampleoutput.txt", but none passed due to lack of knowing how to 
properly call the script with an argument.
